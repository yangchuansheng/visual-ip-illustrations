# Visual IP Routing

This file defines visual-IP selection rules and verifiable route metadata for the skill entrypoint. `SKILL.md` selects the visual IP first, then loads only the selected route's reference files.

## Route Selection Rules

- Omitted visual IP selects `xiaohei`.
- `小黑`, `Xiaohei`, `Ian`, and `ian-xiaohei` select the same `xiaohei` route.
- `小盒`, `Littlebox`, `纸盒`, `paper-box`, and `carton` select the same `littlebox` route.
- `Tom`, `Tom Cat`, `Tom and Jerry`, `汤姆`, and `汤姆猫` select the same `tom` route and keep route status `gated-authorized`.
- `Ferris`, `Rust mascot`, `Rust crab`, `Rustacean`, `Rust 吉祥物`, and `Rust 螃蟹` select the same `ferris` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- `Seal`, `hoodie seal`, `white seal`, `blue hoodie seal`, `海豹`, `连帽衫海豹`, `白色海豹`, and `蓝色连帽衫海豹` select the same `seal` route and keep route status `active`.
- `OpenClaw`, `openclaw`, `OpenClaw logo`, `OpenClaw mascot`, `OpenClaw 助手`, and `OpenClaw 吉祥物` select the same `openclaw` route and keep route status `source-reviewed`.
- Mixed requests across Xiaohei, Littlebox, Tom, Ferris, Seal, and OpenClaw create separate route groups. Compatibility marker: 每个 route group 只加载自己的 `required_references`; each group writes to its own output directory.
- Routes store only selection, references, output suffixes, and attribution context. Style, character identity, prompt wording, and QA rules live in the selected IP's reference files.
- Ferris is an explicit Rust-community mascot route with status source-reviewed; generated public Ferris samples require release review for Rust trademark and endorsement-safe wording.
- Ferris route-local reference directory: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/ferris/`.
- Ferris source/trademark authority: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/ferris/source.md`.
- Seal is an explicit hoodie seal route with status active; generated public Seal samples require release review for hoodie seal identity and no-logo mascot identity.
- Seal route-local reference directory: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/seal/`.
- Seal source-history authority: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/seal/source.md`.
- OpenClaw is an explicit source-reviewed logo-mascot route; generated public OpenClaw samples require release review for uploaded-logo identity and source/license authority.
- OpenClaw route-local reference directory: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/openclaw/`.
- OpenClaw source and uploaded-logo authority: `ian-xiaohei-illustrations/references/ips/openclaw/source.md`.

## OpenClaw Metadata

- Route id: `openclaw`.
- Source authority: official OpenClaw repository, MIT License, and OpenClaw Foundation copyright.
- Uploaded-logo authority: the uploaded red OpenClaw logo is the route visual authority.
- Fixed uploaded-logo markers: red round body, side claw-like arms, two antennae, black eyes, cyan pupils, and short legs.
- Route status: `source-reviewed`.
- Output path: `assets/<article-slug>-openclaw/`; escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-openclaw/`.

## Seal Metadata

- `source_history`: former Sealos Seal route identity migrated to product-neutral Seal
- `canonical_image_status`: uploaded-image-canonical
- `drift_boundary`: uploaded-image-locked
- Fixed visual markers: white rounded seal body, plain navy cap with no logo, plain deep-blue hoodie chest with no logo, glossy dark eyes, black nose, whisker dots, small smile, short rounded flippers, compact legs, and side-rear white tail.
- No-logo markers: no cap logo, no chest logo, no mascot logos, no logo patches, no logo-like wave/cloud mark, no emblem, and no text badge.
- Authority boundary: the uploaded mascot image is the v1.3 shape authority; prior Sealos context remains historical source evidence.

## Legacy Path Availability

Root Xiaohei reference paths remain available during migration and point to canonical pack files:

- `references/style-dna.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/style-dna.md`
- `references/xiaohei-ip.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/xiaohei-ip.md`
- `references/composition-patterns.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/composition-patterns.md`
- `references/prompt-template.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/prompt-template.md`
- `references/qa-checklist.md` -> `references/ips/xiaohei/qa-checklist.md`

## Output Paths

- `xiaohei` output directory remains `assets/<article-slug>-illustrations/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-illustrations/`.
- `xiaohei` filenames continue to use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `littlebox` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-littlebox/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-littlebox/`.
- `littlebox` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `tom` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-tom/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-tom/`.
- `tom` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `ferris` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-ferris/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-ferris/`.
- `ferris` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `seal` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-seal/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-seal/`.
- `seal` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- `openclaw` output directory is `assets/<article-slug>-openclaw/`; validation also keeps escaped marker `assets/&lt;article-slug&gt;-openclaw/`.
- `openclaw` filenames use ordered English slugs such as `01-topic-name.png`.
- Mixed-IP requests split by IP into separate route groups: `xiaohei` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-illustrations/`, `littlebox` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-littlebox/`, `tom` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-tom/`, `ferris` 写入 `assets/<article-slug>-ferris/`, `seal` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-seal/`, and `openclaw` writes to `assets/<article-slug>-openclaw/`.
- Before output, inspect the target directory and choose a new filename to preserve historical results.

## Delivery Report Fields
